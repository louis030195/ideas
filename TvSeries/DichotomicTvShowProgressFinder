# Dichotomic Tv Show Progress Finder

Did you ever stop a tv show a few years ago, and now a new season is out but you don't know when you stopped and you'd like to start there.
What's the best way to know which was the last episode you saw ? Ideally you used a service such as https://trakt.tv/ to keep that information, but it may happen that you didn't.

Idea: use a dichotomic search to find that episode you last saw. First show the user the episode in the middle of the series (just a few minutes at the beginning or the middle). If she didn't see that episode, then it's before, got to the half of the first half, etc.
Most series have less than 100 episodes, so it should take only 6 try to find the right episode. It should take only a minute to know whether the episode was seen or not, so within 5minutes the right episode will have been found.

This requires an access to all the episode of the tv show.
