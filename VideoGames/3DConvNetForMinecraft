# 3D conv net for minecraft

Minecraft is a nice 3d environnement, with a lot of users and lot of 3d content already available (in schematics and in worlds)
In recent years, convolutional network have achieved very good performance at object detection (yolo), object recognition (efficient net) and object generation (largegan)
Even more recently, people have successfully used 3d convnet for tasks such as 3d segmentation and object detection.
The usual imagined application is autonomous driving.

I think it would be highly interesting to apply 3d convnet to minecraft.
The tasks may be :
* generation of new objects
* detection of object : houses, buildings, trees,...
Datasets may be :
* schematics
* worlds : from world distribution or from servers
