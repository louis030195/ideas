# Automatic Book Information Extraction

With recent nlp progress it's now possible to automatically read a book.

The idea is to automatically go through a book, extract mention of characters, places, dates.
It would even be possible to go one step further and use recent progress in transformers to find useful information in text fragments.

Once these information are extracted, it will enable building a book retrieve engine.

Use cases :
* Find in which book a character was mentioned
* Which character often go together
* Technologies mentioned in books
* What kind of scene are present in the book (long talk, short talk, description, action,...)
* Identify the general theme of the book and how much it fits that theme
* Find similar books

In general the idea is to be able to refer to a book without having to reread it completely.
